Requirements:

1. Tasks can be completed
2. Tasks can be reset
3. Tasks have qualifications for who can do the task
4. Tasks have dependencies
5. Dependencies can be generated on the fly
	a. A task can be initialized/assigned and then generate new dependencies, which must then be completed by the creature
6. Tasks can have requirements that ensure that once a certain creature starts doing it's dependencies, it is the only one allowed to finish all the tasks bound by this constraint.
7. Tasks with dependencies can be completed by multiple creatures unless qualifications or constraints forbid it.


Pseudo design:

Task.cs
Guid ID;

abstract void Reset();
abstract void CreateDependencies();
abstract void Prepare();
abstract void Tick();

TaskAssigner.cs

void assign(Living living)
{
	list = get all valid tasks for the living
	

	if the first task in the list can be done by living (check qualifications)
		Task.CreateDependencies();
			grab first item from here, repeat until no more new dependencies
		Reserve the task and all tasks that must be completed by the same character 
		Add the found task to the character, call Prepare();
	else
		check the next item...
}
